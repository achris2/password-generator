## Description

This project is about developing a portfolio website using a CSS framework, Bootstrap. 

It's a small start, but hopefully this is an evergreen project, complementing my previous Portfolio but now including Bootstrap. 

## Installation
No installation required. You will be able to access the website through the following link:

https://achris2.github.io/alex-portfolio/index.html

## Usage

Navigate using your browser, click on the links to be taken to the specific sections. 

I only really have one project live, with the others being place holders. 

Disclaimer: I did not build Netflix, please read the description, it is only a website I *wish* I made.
